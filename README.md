# Kaustubh Shivarkar

I build Solana smart contracts, fullstack dApps, and research web3 security. Currently focused on DeFi protocols, NFT systems, and responsible vulnerability disclosure.

### Solana Development

[**SOLANA_PROJECTS**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/SOLANA_PROJECTS-) is a structured repository of on-chain programs written in Rust using the Anchor framework, progressing from foundational concepts to production-level protocols.

[**AMM**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/anchor-amm-starter-q4-25) — Constant product formula for decentralized token swaps.

[**escrow**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/anchor-escrow-starter-q4-25) — Trustless token exchange with offer, take, and cancel flows between two parties.

[**NFT staking**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/anchor-nft-staking-starter-q4-25) — NFT staking protocol with on-chain reward emission.

[**nft-mplxcore**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/anchor-mplxcore-starter-q4-25) — NFT creation and management via Metaplex Core.

[**prediction market**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/solana_predication_market) — Decentralized prediction market with on-chain settlement and resolution logic.

### Fullstack dApps

[**bullsEye**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/bullsEye_complete) — Built for a hackathon. An accountability platform on Solana where users lock funds against a personal goal and have completion verified by peers through Solana Blinks. Deployed at [bulls-eye-kappa.vercel.app](https://bulls-eye-kappa.vercel.app/)

[**MintX**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/MintX) — Token launchpad and vesting dApp. In progress.

[**betinco**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/betinco) — On-chain betting platform with fullstack integration. Deployed at [betinco.vercel.app](https://betinco.vercel.app/)

### Security Research

[**CTF_Exclusive**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/CTF_Exclusive) — Writeups and scripts from CTF competitions including picoCTF and PortSwigger Web Security Academy, covering web exploitation and general security skills.

[**Security_vuln_Profile**](https://github.com/KaustubhOG/Security_vuln_Profile) — A record of vulnerabilities discovered and responsibly disclosed across live platforms.

```
Severity    Total    Triaged
────────────────────────────
Critical      3         2
High          3         1
Medium        1         0
```

Findings include SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution, OTP Bypass, Reflected XSS, IDOR, and Stack Trace Exposure. Technical details withheld to protect affected systems.
